                            Timelapse of bonsais generated at different growth stages. Each bonsai has slightly different growth patterns which affect branch strength and trunk expansion rate.

                                Branch growth is propogated in the form of energy, starting at the base of the tree and working its way upwards. The development of a branch is limited so that the sum of the girth of the branches does not exceed the girth of the trunk.

                            <h3>About</h3>
                            <p>
                                Bonsai Simulator is all about representing the real processes of tree growth. Care for a potted sapling using simplified bonsai care methods. Trim, prune and wire a potted tree as it ages.
                            </p><p>
                                My goal was to create a system that represented trees as ongoing developing organisms, not just a fixed structure at a single point in time. Rather than having complete control over the growth of the bonsai, the tree grows according to an annual system and as a player you have limited tools to influence the tree's appearance. What you choose to prune will affect not just the appearance of the bonsai, but also it's health in the future.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Development Process</h3>
                            <p>
                                This project was heavily inspired by actual bonsai care practices. I researched the growth patterns of trees both prior to and throughout development. This research not only added realism to my simulation but also simplified the design of the system by keeping only systems based on real natural processes.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My system's design revolves around three main programming concepts: interfaces, vectors, and of course, trees.
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <b>Trees (data structure): </b>
                                    <p>The benefit of using this data structure is that there is already lots of literature and researched systems that can be applied to make my life easier when modeling an actual tree (recursion, tree traversals, branching).</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <b>Interfaces</b>
                                    <p>To coordinate growth across the tree, I implement an interface called "Growth." Each segment of the tree may grow in a different way or perform different actions at the end of every year, but the interface allows these different actions to be coordinated and invoked at once. </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <b>Vectors</b>
                                    <p>Each branch is represented by a sum of vectors which determines it's direction and length. In addition to a branch's facing direction, a weight vector is computed based on the length and girth of all branches above a given branch.</p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                                The Desert is a calm, meditative, mobile experience that makes your phone into a window through which one sees the world transformed into a barren sandy landscape. The Desert was first pitched as part of a game narratives course. The game is about helping people pay more attention to the experiences we have interacting with our physical environments.

                            <p>
                                I am working on this game as a solo project. So far, I have written custom APIs to process geospatial data in Unity and handle downloading terrain data based on player location. I have also designed in engine terrain lighting and coded a system for rendering time of day according to the time of day in the real world.

                                Lunar Lander is an arcade game about landing a spacecraft on the moon with a limited amount of fuel. This project combines various reinforcement learning techniques to train an AI to land the spaceship correctly while using as little fuel as possible.

                            <p>
                                The first stage of the project involved recreating Lunar Lander in Java. I wrote custom physics and rendered the game using only shapes and drawing techniques native to the Java Swing package. For the AI portion of the project, I designed a separate engine for computing the physics and information necessary for the AI to play the game. Then I modified the original game to allow the AI agent to play, including features that would make training and modifying the AI easier.

                            <p>
                                The Park Behind my House is an explorable, hand-painted and hand-modeled 3D environment. It features a dynamic music system and lots of environmental animations, from moving clouds to swaying leaves, blowing grass, sunrays and mist.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Development Process</h3>
                            <p>
                                As a submission to a traditional art show, the focus of this project was it's environment and the acryllic painting that makes up most of the game's textures. The goal of this project was to work on every part of the game development pipeline. This is best seen in the game's playable character, which I drew concept art for, then modeled, textured, and animated in Blender. I then handled movement controls, footstep sounds, and controlling the animations in Unity. The player model is shaded with a custom toon shader, and natural swaying effects are all rendered with HLSL.

                                All music was composed and performed by a classmate, Xander. This project makes use of some Unity store nature assets for its forest zone and some Quixel textures for the ground in the maze zone.
