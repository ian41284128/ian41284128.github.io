            <p class="type">Hi, my name is Ian,</p>
            <p class="type">
                I recently graduated with a B.S. in computer science from NYU Shanghai and love programming gameplay, simulating nature, and experimenting with graphics. I like programming best when it makes art, and my passion projects often integrate my interest for 3D modeling and physical art such as acrylics and pen/pencil. I am Experienced with Unity, C#, and Javascript frameworks like P5 and Three, and dream of making video games for a living.

                                The Desert is a calm, meditative, mobile experience that makes your phone into a window through which one sees the world transformed into a barren sandy landscape. The Desert was first pitched as part of a game narratives course. The game is about helping people pay more attention to the experiences we have interacting with our physical environments.

                            <p>
                                I am working on this game as a solo project. So far, I have written custom APIs to process geospatial data in Unity and handle downloading terrain data based on player location. I have also designed in engine terrain lighting and coded a system for rendering time of day according to the time of day in the real world.

                                Lunar Lander is an arcade game about landing a spacecraft on the moon with a limited amount of fuel. This project combines various reinforcement learning techniques to train an AI to land the spaceship correctly while using as little fuel as possible.

                            <h3>Development Process</h3>
                            <p>
                                The first stage of the project involved recreating Lunar Lander in Java. I wrote custom physics and rendered the game using only shapes and drawing techniques native to the Java Swing package. For the AI portion of the project, I designed a separate engine for computing the physics and information necessary for the AI to play the game. Then I modified the original game to allow the AI agent to play, including features that would make training and modifying the AI easier.

                                My Virtual Apartment is a 3D room that displays html content on each of its four walls. The goal was to mockup a portfolio website that was full of personality and demonstrated my interests in 3D modelling, rendering, and programming.

                                I produced all 3D assets found in the project and used baked lighting to reduce performance cost on web browsers. In addition to rendering the model using the Three.JS javascript library, I made use of CSS 3D Transforms and css environment variables to render basic HTML on top of the 3D scene.

                                Keep It Together is a short game about stress and time management. It requires only a mouse/trackpad to play. You must keep various floating obligations within your clock face. As they stack up you may be forced to throw them out quickly but be careful; if they collide everything could fall apart.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                This game was inspired by a difficult time managing school and a long commute to work. I wanted to make a game out of the things I do to relax, so I picked tools that I enjoy using to destress. At the time I was having a lot of fun with P5.js, so I decided it was a simple environment for a short web game. I also had a small watercolor set at the time and used it to paint the moving assets in the game.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As for future changes, besides tweaking gameplay slightly, I would have enjoyed making all UI elements out of watercolor.

                                I used Matter.js for the physics simulations, because calculating object collisions efficiently in P5.js wasn't really possible in my timeframe for this project.

                            <p>
                                The Park Behind my House is an explorable, hand-painted and hand-modeled 3D environment. It features a dynamic music system and lots of environmental animations, from moving clouds to swaying leaves, blowing grass, sunrays and mist.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Development Process</h3>
                            <p>
                                As a submission to a traditional art show, the focus of this project was it's environment and the acryllic painting that makes up most of the game's textures. The goal of this project was to work on every part of the game development pipeline. This is best seen in the game's playable character, which I drew concept art for, then modeled, textured, and animated in Blender. I then handled movement controls, footstep sounds, and controlling the animations in Unity. The player model is shaded with a custom toon shader, and natural swaying effects are all rendered with HLSL.

                                All music was composed and performed by a classmate, Xander. This project makes use of some Unity store nature assets for its forest zone and some Quixel textures for the ground in the maze zone.
